Data import, transformation, wrangling, and analysis (using R-studio) to help a major retail chain understand their customers better

## Abstract
This data analytics case study deals with two problem statements. First, we help our client wth insights on what demographic factors (such as age, income, marital status, size of household, number of children in the family, etc.) influence the spending of their consumers. We use visual analytics in R (using R ggplot graphics) to inspect trends and then build a 'linear regression' model (using more than 800 unique customer transactions) to make predictions and draw inferences. One key takeaway for our client from this study is that they can now better infer (based on demographics) whether a consumer is likely to be a high spender or a low spender. 

Second, our client wanted to understand how each consumer is engaged with their product categories. We leveraged the 'total spend' and the 'categories' variables (across more than 3000 customer transactions) and applied a K-means segmentation procedure to match customers to the most likely segment they would fall into. This insight helps our client know each customer better, better align product related merchandise inside their stores, and run more accurate cross-sell promotions. For instance, to promote a new automotive product in the store, promotional e-mail should be sent to all household in the segment “L-Automotive Products”. And to run a cross-promotion for 'Garden Supplies' the most profitable target segment should be 'Cosmetics' buyers since these two segments show common consumer affinity. 

In addition to the data modeling and business insights, this case study also demonstrates how to wrangle, clean and transform voluminous data from multiple large datasets, and prepare the data for analysis. This part assumes importance also because data scientists often spend more than 70% of their time in wrangling and transforming of the data before getting into the analysis.
